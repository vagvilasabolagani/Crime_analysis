## Data Source

- [Crime Data from 2020 to Present](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/crime-data-from-2020-to-present)

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python**: Programming language used for data analysis.
- **Pandas**: Library used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Libraries used for data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Environment used for interactive coding and visualization.

## Exploration Questions

1. What are the areas with the highest and lowest crime incidents in LA?
2. Identify the number of crimes that occurred each year and each month of every year in the data provided.
3. What is the percentage of crimes that occurred in each:
   - Time of the day
   - Type of gender
   - Age group
4. How is the status of the crime distributed in the data?
5. What are the 5 most common crime types when the crime is reported 7 days later?
6. How is the crime status distributed across all genders?
7. What is the importance of data cleansing and data entry, and how can they affect analyzing the data?

## Data Analysis Steps

### Data Collection

1. **Load Data**: Import the dataset from the provided link.
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   df = pd.read_csv('path_to_crime_data.csv')
   ```

### Data Preprocessing

1. **Clean Data**: Handle missing values, correct data types, and normalize data for analysis.
2. **Transform Data**: Create new columns for analysis, such as categorizing times of the day and age groups.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarize the dataset to understand its structure and contents.
2. **Identify Crime Hotspots**: Analyze areas with the highest and lowest crime incidents.
3. **Temporal Analysis**: Analyze the number of crimes by year and month.

### Visualization

1. **Crime Distribution**: Visualize the distribution of crime status, types, and demographics (gender, age).
2. **Common Crime Types**: Identify and visualize the most common crime types reported late.

## Importance of Data Cleansing and Data Entry

Data cleansing and accurate data entry are critical for reliable analysis. Inaccurate or incomplete data can lead to incorrect conclusions and affect decision-making. Ensuring data quality through thorough cleaning and validation improves the reliability and accuracy of insights derived from the analysis.
